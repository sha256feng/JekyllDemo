This is almost at the *end of 2018*. This is such a fantastic year. We don't know what is going to happen next year. But apprently no Olympics LoL.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
