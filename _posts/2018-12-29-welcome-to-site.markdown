Hi Welcome! This is the personal website by Shasha!!

Since Shasha thought sha is somehow in tech, it makes sense to build the personal website via Github. People can then come to know about the research and maybe brainstorm together. 

Shasha is also, in some cases, a bit talktive. Keeping a blog sounds a pretty new year gift. 

The website is not *well-founded* yet, like RSS so far doesn't work. Please don't click RSS feed! :sweat_smile:
