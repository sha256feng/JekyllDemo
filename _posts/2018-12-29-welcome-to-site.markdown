Hi Welcome! This is the personal website by Shasha!!

Since I think I am in tech, it makes sense to build my personal website via Github. People can then come to know what research I am doing and maybe brainstorm with me. 

I am also, in most cases, a bit talktive. Keeping a blog sounds a pretty new year gift. So I can scratch down some funny stuff in mind. The website is not well-founded yet, like RSS so far doesn't work. Please don't click RSS feed!
