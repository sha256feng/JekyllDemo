**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

2017.6– Present                      LehighUniversity 
                                     ResearchAdvisor: Wonpil Im, PhD
· Used molecular dynamics simulation tostudy activation and functional modulation of TRPV2 cationic channel, includingcannabidiol activation, PI(4,5)P2, glycosylation; explore conformational changeof open and closed channels. (In collaboration with VeraMoiseenkova-Bell, PhD, University of Pennsylvania)

· Parameterized archaeal lipids in CHARMMforce field, used molecular dynamics simulation to study archaeal bilayer membraneproperty, proved that it provides a different membrane environment, elucidatedquinone’s conformation in bilayer. (Co-advised by JefferyB. Klauda, PhD, University of Maryland)

2017.11– 2018.7                    PekingUniversity
                                   Research Advisor: Chen Song, PhD
· Parameterized special plant sphingolipidsin CHARMM force field, to study why a protein has preference for certain lipidstypes.
